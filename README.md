# geoPhotoViewer_v0-2

### Abstract
Geospatial web application to host historical or time-lapsed photographs with a spatial component.

### Version
The application is at version 0.2.

### Updates
-The options pane is not complete (still need to filter based on photograph time (additional options could be added based on the metadata for the photograph collections).
-Eventually, the application should run off of an enterprise database (hosted on a web server or through Portal for ArcGIS) rather than a combination of .csv and .xml files
